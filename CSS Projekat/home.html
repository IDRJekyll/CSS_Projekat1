        <p>The SCP Foundation; is a globe spanning organization tasked with mantaining, upholding and protecting the
            safety of the human race against the paranormal. We handle the things that stalk the night.
            but we do not aim to destroy such phenomena. Instead, we aim to capture, contain and study these paranormal
            entities, locations or events. So that we can prepare for anymore that might happen in the future. Knowledge
            is the key, and we are the keepers of it. Some seek to stop us in this unholy task, but it is up to us to
            defend against such threats, and keep the humanity safe from the darkness.</p>
