        <p>Welcome to the Foundation! Where we handle the things that go lurk in the dark. While the humanity doesn't
            realize we exist, and might critique our methods. We are the necessary evil when it comes to the job that we
            do.<img src="slike/SCP_Foundation_(emblem).svg.png" alt=""></p>

                    would consider impossible. And we do it in order to protect humanity from everything and anything
                    that we consider illogical. We are the unsung heroes of all your monster stories.</p>
